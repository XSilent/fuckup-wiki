FUCKUP-Wiki - A free Wiki Software

2011-02-16, Version 0.6, Michael Neuhaus
----------------------------------------

	Refactoring:
	The Version 0.6 is the result of the refactoring
	of the FUCKUP-Wiki code version 0.4 from 2004, 
	originally written by Mutwin Kraus and Lukas Bombach.
	
	- the code was ported from PHP4 to PHP5
	
	- all functions where grouped to classes
	
	- some new class/interfaces introduced
	
	- some unreachable code was removed
	
	- the html layout was splitted in more files
	to give more possibilities for own templates
	
	- the user passwords are now stored as hased values
	(the hash algo is configurable)
	
	- new possibility to use wiki extensions via wiki
	elements: [Wikielement: "<FWikiClassName>"]
	
	- bugfix: On new user registration, a new wiki page
	will be stored (with the username)
